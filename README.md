## The Idea
Inspired by [Tunis by celtano](https://themeforest.net/item/tunis-personal-portfolio/26761598), I created this website from scratch using HTML, CSS & JavaScript, tailoring it to my own vision. CSS Grid & Flexbox are used to make the website `Fully Responsive`. And [vanilla-tilt.js library](https://micku7zu.github.io/vanilla-tilt.js/) is used to add the tilt effect to photos/project cards.

Information on how I deployed the website on Github Pages can be found [here](https://dreamsfromcode.com/how-to-set-up-a-live-website-using-github-pages-for-free-step-by-step-guide/66/).
